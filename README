-------- Battle Rhythm Game --------

This project is started as a HSC Major Work but is intnded to continue as an open source project.

Initial designs involved a hybrid rhythm/rpg game with character progression and abilities that could be used during a 'battle'. Many of the ideas for rpg mechanics have subsequently been dropped to improve accessibility and target audience spectrum. Instead the game will have a unique set of modes and puzzle game elements.

Language is Python 3.3 and uses the pygame library
