-------- Battle Rhythm Game --------

This project is started as a HSC Major Work but is intnded to continue as an open source project.

The core of this project is a 4 track rhythm game. From left to right the notes are scored with Q, W, O and P when they are within the scoring area.

Instant rhythm mode allows the player to quickly choose a song and begin playing any of the game's songs.

Posts on this blog document the development of the game. http://designingcodeisart.blogspot.com.au/
